					<div>Introduction</div>
				</h2>
				<p>
					New York City has a reputation for its clean tasty drinking water, so why do we still see countless single-use plastic bottles in convenience store, cafes, offices, and in the hands of pedestrians?
				</p>
				<p>
					At any given time, NYC hosts numerous visitors as well as the 8.6 million people who call it home.
					There are approximately 3,000 public drinking fountains in parks across New Yorkthe city, and about 50 modern fountain and bottle refill stations in the 5 boroughs.
					Furthermore, difficulty in locating these fountains  they are difficult to locate when needed and when combined with  a general mistrust of the fountain’s cleanliness;, the fountains which are meant to provide water for the masses, miss the mark. Instead, New Yorkers, and visitors, turn to what is convenient and more widely available: the single-use plastic water bottle. Often made of plastic, tThis solution to the urban scarcity issue is all about convenience,. Yet,  although it is a harmful and wasteful habit. Recycling is not as comprehensive and useful of a process in managing plastic waste. Data gathered from the DSNY regarding diversion and capture rates of recyclable materials are low, about 15% and 50% respectively. After successful processing, recyclables are often transported and sold to facilities around the world for other uses.
					The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that 80% of plastic pollution in the ocean originates as land based trash, including plastic bags and bottles which eventually ends up in landfills and oceans. It is evident, New York City, and other cities like it, requires a new model for of providing access to drinking water at the street level in order to decrease and eventually stop dependence on single-use plastic.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our team has developed a concept utilizing a shared economy model in the field of water distribution, after analysis After a bit of investigation of available resources and a first survey ofwith about almost 100 New York residents, commuters, and visitors (herein all will be referred to as New Yorkers/ Customer/ Users), Our water station will offer shared bottles that the  customers can fill and refill with tap water, and return to any station for cleaning. Our solutions is meant toThis will help in reduction  reduceof plastic pollution, use  as the water bottles produced createdwill be made out of reusable materials, and the system will increase usage of reusable bottles in lieu of buying single use bottles new ones each time a customer is thirsty. The results of the survey we conducted suggestscorroborated that New Yorkers trust city tap water and that people are willing to carry water bottles with them if they are convenient. our plan is to gain the customer’s trust in both the cleanliness of the bottle as well as providing them with a convenient and cost effective replacement to the current single use plastic bottle purchase.
				</p>
				<p>
					in alignment with Our goals align with the NYC EPA mission to provide more water fountains by 2025, in order to make water more accessible to people. Wwe look at targeting to target major areas in the city where people are most in need of access to water., and further expand to other parts.
				</p>

					<div>Infrastructure</div>
				</h2>
				<p>
					Our system is dependent on connecting with the existing NYC water distribution infrastructure, similar to existing water fountains. We are consideringhave considered multiple options for our concept system, and before implementation we plan on spending significant amount of time working with each community to better understand their needs see what their needs are as to  and preference of “water station locations. of “water stations”, In addition, we hope to gain their trust in cleaning options, and their willingness to participate.. This is going back to our goal of creating a convenient system and building trust with our customers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our vision revolves around the idea of having water bottle refilling and dispensing stations in every neighborhood. the location of these stations is dependant on the following factors: Our plan is to eventually have stations in every neighborhood, but their location is dependent on several factors. We will need to set up in locations that can easy connection to the municipal water lines.,  With our current design, we plan on setting up stations along heavy commute lines with  but and eventually increase availability in less served communities that are not along transportation lines. , and lastly , Ppark entrances due to their high concentration ofare also highly considered locations due to the amount of athletic activities and visitors. After uUsers  would borrow and fill a bottle they can fill it at any water fountains found mostly in the parks and then return it the bottles as they leave the park.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are several potential cleaning options we are currently considering. Along with community input, we will need to conduct further investigation of feasibility, energy needs, water usage, and other environmental impacts of each option needs to be evaluated. Current options include: setting up a cleaning facility to transport the used bottles to, implementing a washing machine into each system, and encourageing  volunteers and or hiring employees to clean bottles. Our hope is Whenever we need to, we hope to train and employ people who currently sell bottles of water bottles for a living andor those whothat collect used bottles to sell at collection facilities.
				</p>
				<h2>
					<div class="fa fa-map-pin"></div>
					<div> Stations </div>
				</h2>
				<p>
					Our water stations will be as much a part of the new NYC streetscape as phone booths use to be in the past., and now parking meters, light poles, bike parking, and LinkNYC stations. T The aesthetics of the design will be simple and utilize muted colors with easy to identify graphicslogos. One of our key components are graphics in various languages next to each water dispensing unit to help in creatinge a better user experience. We hope an easy to use interface with graphics and multiple language options can contribute to the overall user experience. In addition, we would provide our users the ability to take to providing a quick survey, add comments and feedback regarding their experience using the machine. In order to increase the number of people using our devices we plan to A quarterly survey of a group of random people will be conductedevery quarter to confirm if the changes we made are effective and how they we can be improve.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each machine will have a software to track the locations with the most foot traffic, day of week and time of day with most number of users, and analytics to determine whether or not closeness or accessibility to heavily footed areas of the city does in fact contribute to increase in number of people who use our machine.

					<div class="fa fa-bolt"></div>
					<div> Energy Consumption </div>
				</h2>
				<p>
					Our water disposing machine is composed of two separate portions: the body and the solar panels that provide power. We conducted an estimate of energy needed by considering the body of our machine as a combination of a vending machine and a dishwasher. The machine will utilize dual power from both electricity and solar panels. The following assumptions are based on the standard options available in the market today. This being said, using an average vending machine that consumes 4400KWhr/year with 72"H x 39"W x 33"D dimensions, we would need a lot of electricity. With the assumption that the vending machine is used to 40% of its needed electricity at 2640 KWhrs/year; (5) 1KW solar panels would be able to provide 4250KWhr of electricity per year. A dishwashing machine that consumes 200KWhr/year, and is used 4 times a week every week consumes about 1.05KWhr/load. With the knowledge that 1610 KWhrs of electricity are annually provided to the dishwasher, it can run on average about 4 times a day every year.
				</p>
				<p>
					PV panels located on top of our machine are to create a more energy efficient and sustainable system. Our idea was to decrease the cost of electricity and greenhouse gas emission. New york city’s main power is supplied from natural gas, nuclear power plants and hydropower. Our main source of energy for the operation of the machines is solar power. In addition, we are aiming to use renewable energy in the production of our machines and our bottles. Notably, travel distance from production to operation will be minimized to keep the environmental impact as low as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					This being said, our goal is to minimize the GHG emission for the production of the machines as well as the bottles. Depending on the material selected after further survey and communications with the customers for the bottle materials, we would be able to better understand how much GHG we are producing and how we can minimize it. However, it is worth noting that our goal is to reuse and recycle and not destroy. Additionally, refrigerants used for keeping water cool will also be taken into consideration to determine how much GHG is emitted from the overall manufacturing, production and, operation of our machines.
				</p>

					<div> Bottle </div>
				</h2>
				<p>
					The bottle is the item that the user will interact with the most and carry throughout the day with them. Our design considers the average daily handling of a water bottle and the needs of someone spending most of their time traveling around the city. The bottle needs to be durable enough to withstand a few drops while maintaining a lightweight so it is not a burden when carried throughout the day. Besides consideration of the user’s experience with the bottle, the material we select must comply with one of our main goals of decreasing environmental impact. With all this in mind and after consideration of a variety of materials, we narrowed down our options to stainless steel and glass. With further surveys and interactions with our users we will be able to settle on a design and a material that will fit their needs and hopefully increase usage of the bottle once we launch our system. In the future, if our system is implemented, we hope to work with a variety of designers and local non-profit organizations to create special limited edition bottles. This might entice more users and bring awareness to the non-profits.

					<div class="fa fa-dollar-sign"></div>
					<div> Business Plan </div>
				</h2>
				<p>
					One of the core goals of this shared system is to extend existing infrastructure and create a resource that is accessible for all, without the elitism that can surround some environmental initiatives. Our system would have a free water dispensing option that anyone could use, ensuring equitable water access; in addition to that, we would have a subscription plan available for those who would like advanced features. Similar to farmers’ markets, there would be an option for SNAP/EBT cards as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					Monthly subscriptions would be available, especially for visitors to the city, and a yearly plan would offer a discount on the monthly plan and cost. For instance, if a monthly subscription plan was $3 each month, a yearly plan would cost $24, about the same as a reusable water bottle. While single-use water bottle use varies, spending a conservative $1 for 1 bottle of water every day would result in $365 of water bottle purchases each year, significantly more than a yearly subscription fee. Initial costs would include installation of the water dispensing systems and bottles; ongoing costs would be system maintenance.
				</p>
				<p>
					We would partner with grassroots community organizations throughout the process to ensure that our project is truly contributing to the residents of the city and not exacerbating issues like gentrification. Ideally, we would like to create a public-private partnership with New York City agencies like the Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Transportation, and Department of Health. This would allow for a more widespread reach of our systems throughout the city. Outreach could include educational booths at farmers’ markets, schools and universities, street fairs, and potentially at programs like NYCHA Green Corps. In addition, we could use both online advertising and public bus stations, libraries, and more; ideally our system would eventually be incorporated into maps of public resources. We hope that the system would catch on in New York City and eventually spread to other cities around the world, adapted to their local water system and needs.
				</p>
				<h2>
					<div class="fa fa-lightbulb"></div>
					<div> Community Information </div>
				</h2>
				<p>
					Education often times is as important as recycling itself.  Our main target audience; people who care about the environment, recycle for the purpose of sustainability and others who are visiting the city or want to participate out of curiosity should be educated on what they are consuming and how they are affecting the environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Understanding why and how we are recycling, cleaning, and reusing provides transparency and educates people on our base values and target goals. Providing  statistics on how much less waste we are creating in comparison to the numbers provided by the city are all part of providing people with the knowledge on how we are impacting the environment. Part of the reason water fountains, water filtration systems and NYC tap water is not trusted is the lack of knowledge on the chemical components in the water. Another aspect of our transparent goal is by providing people with DEP safe drinking water requirements in comparison to our quarterly water testing results. Bottled water based on FDA regulations is not tested as often as tap water, with this in mind our main goal is to continuously test the water we are providing to the people. The easiest form of education is by having pictures and posters at locations in the city with the most foot traffic, bus stops and subway stations. For the population who would like to do further research, they will be able to find more information on our website and videos of how it all came together.
				</p>
				<h2>
					<div class="fa fa-list-ol"></div>
					<div> Preliminary Launch Plan </div>
				</h2>
				<p>
					We created a preliminary survey to understand the current drinking water habits of a sample of NYC residents; we would like to expand this to a more rigorous survey with a larger sample size. We would like to hold meetings within the communities we seek to serve and select a group of beta testers to launch a minimum viable product (MVP) version of our system. For instance, we would start simple with tables placed throughout a public area with reusable water bottles and refill stations available. We would use this to test ideal water bottle material, the kinds of features that customers would find useful, ideal distance between stations, etc. After initial testing is complete, we would continue to iterate on the design during a pilot program. We would start in more diverse areas of the city to ensure that the system is designed with everyone’s needs in mind instead of catering only to tourists or the wealthy (at the time of this writing, Jamaica Estates, Holliswood, and Briarwood were listed as the
