				<div>Introduction</div>
			</h2>
			<section class="col-2">
				<p>New York City has a reputation for its clean drinking water, so why do we still see countless single-use plastic bottles in convenience stores, cafes, offices, and in the hands of pedestrians?
				</p><p>At any given time, NYC hosts numerous visitors as well as the 8.6 million people who call it home. There are approximately 3,000 public drinking fountains in parks across NYC, and about 50 modern fountain and bottle refill stations in the 5 boroughs. Furthermore, difficulty in locating these fountains combined with general mistrust of the fountain’s cleanliness; the fountains which are meant to provide water for the masses, miss the mark. Instead, New Yorkers, and visitors turn to what is convenient and widely available: the single-use plastic water bottle. This solution to the urban scarcity issue is about convenience,  although it is a harmful and wasteful habit. Recycling is not as comprehensive and useful of a process in managing plastic waste as suggested by data  gathered from DSNY regarding diversion and capture rates of recyclable materials, which are about 15% and 50% respectively. After successful processing, recyclables are often transported and sold to facilities around the world for other uses. As our largest importer, China, decreases its import of recyclables, most plastics will likely end up in landfills or the ocean. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that 80% of plastic pollution in the ocean originates as land based trash, including plastic bags and bottles. It is evident, New York City, and cities like it, require a new model for  providing access to drinking water at the street level in order to decrease and eventually stop dependence on single-use plastic.
				</p><p>Our team has developed a concept utilizing a shared economy model in the field of water distribution, after analysis of available resources and a survey of about  100 New York residents, commuters, and visitors (herein referred to as New Yorkers/Customer/Users). Our water station will offer shared bottles that customers can fill and refill with tap water, and return to any station for cleaning. Our solutions is meant to reduce plastic pollution by using water bottles produced out of renewable materials, and increasing usage of reusable bottles in lieu of buying single use bottles . The results of the survey we conducted suggests New Yorkers trust city tap water and are willing to carry water bottles with them if they are convenient. We plan to gain the customer’s trust in both the cleanliness of the bottle as well as to provide them with a convenient and cost effective replacement to the current single use plastic bottle.
				</p><p>In alignment with NYC government’s  mission to provide more water fountains by 2025,we look at targeting major areas in the city where people are most in need of access to water.

				<div>Infrastructure</div>
			</h2>

			<section class="col-2">
				<p>Our system is dependent on connecting with the existing NYC water distribution infrastructure, similar to existing water fountains. We are considering multiple options for our concept system, before implementation we plan on spending significant amount of time working with each community to better understand their needs  and preference of water station locations. In addition, we hope to gain their trust in cleaning options, and their willingness to participate.
				</p><p>Our vision revolves around the idea of having water bottle refilling and dispensing stations in every neighborhood. The location of these stations is dependant on the following factors: easy connection to municipal water lines, stations along heavy commute lines with increase availability in less served communities , access to sunlight for power, and lastly public park entrances due to their high concentration of athletic activities and visitors.
				</p><p>There are several potential cleaning options we are currently considering. Along with community input, further investigation of feasibility, energy needs, water usage, and other environmental impacts of each option needs to be completed. Current options include: setting up a cleaning facility to transport used bottles, implement a washing machine into each system, and encourage volunteers and employees to clean bottles. Our hope is to train and employ people who currently sell water bottles for a living and those who collect used bottles to sell at collection facilities.
				</p>

				<div class="fa fa-bolt"></div>
				<div> Energy Consumption </div>
			</h2>

			<section class="col-2">
				<p>Our water dispensing station design is composed of two separate portions: the body and the solar panels that provide power. We conducted an energy estimate by considering the body of our machine as a combination of a vending machine and a dishwasher. . The machine will utilize dual power from both municipal electricity and solar panels. However, the following assumptions are based on the standard options available in the market today using only solar power. This being said, using an average vending machine consumes 4400 KWhr/year with 72"H x 39"W x 33"D dimensions. Based on estimates of common uses of delamping and compressor control methods we should be able to cut output by 40% to 2640 KWhrs/year;  (five) 1KW solar panels would be able to provide 4250 KWhr of electricity per year. If a dishwashing machine that consumes 200 KWhr/year is used four times a week, every week, it consumes about 1.05 KWhr/load. With the knowledge that 1610 KWhrs of electricity are annually dedicated to the dishwasher, it can run on average about 4 times a day every year. Notably, five water dispensing machines can fit comfortably under the five solar panels.
				</p><p>NYC’s main power is supplied from natural gas, nuclear power plants and hydropower.  Our idea was to decrease the cost and usage of non-renewable electricity and greenhouse gas emission (GHG), as well as to create a more energy efficient and sustainable system.  Minimizing travel distance from production to operation will help keep environmental impact as low as possible.  Bottle material will be selected after further survey and communications with the customers. This knowledge will aid in understanding how much GHG is produced and how it can be minimized.

				<div> Stations </div>
			</h2>

			<section class="col-2">
				<p>Our water stations will be part of the new NYC streetscape as much as parking meters, light poles, bike parking, and LinkNYC stations are now. The aesthetics of the design will be simple and utilize earthy colors with easy to identify graphics in various languages next to each water dispensing unit to help in creating a better user experience. In addition, we would provide our users the ability to take a quick survey, add comments and feedback regarding their experience using the machine. A quarterly survey of a group of random people will be conducted to confirm if the changes made are effective and how they  can be improved.
				</p><p>Each machine will have software to track the locations with the most foot traffic, day of week and time of day with most number of users, and analytics to determine whether or not closeness or accessibility to heavily footed areas of the city does in fact contribute to increase in number of people who use our machine. We are also considering the creation of a mobile application with a simple interactive map to notify users of nearby stations and available bottles.

				<div> Bottle Design </div>
			</h2>

			<section class="col-2">
				<p>
					The bottle is the item that the user will interact with the most and carry with them throughout the day. Our design considers the average daily handling of a water bottle and the needs of someone spending most of their time traveling around the city. It is essential that the bottle is durable enough to withstand a few impacts while maintaining a light weight as to not become a burden when carried throughout the day. in addition to consideration of the user’s experience with the bottle, the water bottle material selected must comply with our main goal of decreasing environmental impact. After consideration of a variety of materials; we narrowed down our options to stainless steel and glass. Bottle material and design will be determined after further surveys and interactions with our users to fit their needs. We hope these surveys and interactions will increase the usage of the bottle once we launch our system. In the future, we hope to work with a variety of designers and local non-profit organizations to create special limited edition bottles with the hopes that this might entice more users and bring awareness to the non-profits.

					<div class="fa fa-file-invoice-dollar"></div>
					<div> Business Plan </div>
				</h2>

				<p>One of the core goals of this shared system is to extend existing infrastructure and create a resource that is accessible to all, without the elitism that can surround some environmental initiatives. Our system would have a free water dispensing option that anyone could use, ensuring equitable water access; in addition to that, we would have a subscription plan available for those who would like advanced features. Similar to farmers’ markets, we hope to open an option for SNAP/EBT cards as well.
				</p><p>Additionally, monthly subscriptions would be available, for visitors to the city, and a yearly plan with additional discount on the monthly plan and cost. For instance, if a monthly subscription plan was $3 each month, a yearly plan would cost $24, about the same as a reusable water bottle. While single-use water bottle use varies, spending a conservative $1 for 1 bottle of water every day would result in $365 of water bottle purchases each year, significantly more than a yearly subscription fee. Initial costs would include installation of the water dispensing systems and bottles; ongoing costs would be system maintenance.
				</p><p>We would partner with grassroots community organizations throughout the process to ensure that our project is truly contributing to the residents of the city and not exacerbating issues like gentrification. Ideally, we would like to create a public-private partnership with New York City agencies like the Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Transportation, and Department of Health. This would allow for a more widespread reach of our systems throughout the city. Outreach would include educational booths at farmers’ markets, schools and universities, street fairs, and potentially at programs like NYCHA Green Corps. In addition, we would use both online advertising and public bus stations, libraries, and more; ideally our system would be incorporated into maps of public resources. We hope that the system would catch on in New York City and eventually spread to other cities around the world, adapted to their local water system and needs.

					<div> Community Outreach </div>
				</h2>

				<p>Education often times is as important as recycling itself.  Our main target audience; people who care about the environment, recycle for the purpose of sustainability and others who are visiting the city or want to participate out of curiosity should be educated on what they are consuming and how they are affecting the environment. The easiest form of education is by having pictures and posters at locations in the city with the most foot traffic, bus stops and subway stations.
				</p><p>Understanding why and how we are cleaning and reusing, provides transparency and educates people on our base values and target goals. We would provide our users with  statistics on how much less waste we are creating in comparison to the numbers provided by the city and how this impacts the environment. Another aspect of our transparent goal is by providing people with DEP safe drinking water requirements in comparison to our quarterly water testing results. Lack of knowledge on the chemical components of the water is part of the reason water fountains, water filtration systems and NYC tap water is not trusted. Bottled water based on FDA regulations is not tested as often as tap water; with this in mind, our main goal is to continuously test the water we are providing to the people. For the population who would like to do further research, they will be able to find more information on our website and videos of how it all came together.

				<h2>
					<div class="fa fa-list-ol"></div>
					<div> Preliminary Launch Plan </div>
				</h2>
				<p>
					We created a preliminary survey to understand the current drinking water habits of a sample of about 100 NYC residents; we would like to expand this to a more rigorous survey with a larger sample size. We would like to hold meetings within the communities we seek to serve and select a group of beta testers to launch a minimum viable product (MVP) version of our system. For instance, we would start with reusable water bottles and refill stations available on tables placed throughout a public area. We would use this to test ideal water bottle material, the kinds of features that customers would find useful, ideal distance between stations, etc. After initial testing is complete, we would continue to iterate on the design during a pilot program. We would start in more diverse areas of the city to ensure that our system is designed with everyone’s needs in mind instead of catering only to tourists or the wealthy (at the time of this writing, Jamaica Estates, Holliswood, and Briarwood were listed as the most diverse neighborhoods in NYC).
